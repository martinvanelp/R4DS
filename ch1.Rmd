knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(ggplot2)
```

## First steps

1. Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?

```{r first-steps-1}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

We see nothing because no aesthetics have been added.

2. How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?

```{r first-steps-2}
nrow(mpg)
ncol(mpg)
```

3. What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.

"the type of drive train, where f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd"

4. Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.

```{r first-steps-4}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
    geom_point(aes(x = hwy, y = cyl))
```

5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?

```{r first-steps-5}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
    geom_point(aes(x = class, y = drv))
```

This graph is not useful because points are overlapping and there is also no
discernible pattern in the data with this plot.
